    "content": "<p class=\"indent\"><span style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">Hi, I’m Rirue — my newest project alias. I contributed an original song called&nbsp;</span><span data-start=\"180\" data-end=\"199\" style=\"text-indent: 2em;\"><i>Summer Never Ends</i></span><span style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtube.com/@aotelier\" target=\"_blank\">Aotelier</a>&nbsp;to the Alohaii-inspired fan album&nbsp;</span><em data-start=\"234\" data-end=\"257\" style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">Letters from Paradise</em><span style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">.</span></p><p class=\"indent\"><span style=\"text-indent: 0px;\">First, I want to say thank you to everyone who gave me the opportunity to be part of this amazing project. Something I’ve never done before in my life. It made me realize that I should have done this earlier. But I’m really glad it’s finally finished!</span></p><p class=\"indent\">And secondly, Idk what to write on this article. I haven't write anything for the last couple years. So, maybe I'm losing some of my ability. But, well, let me tell you something cool about this song that I wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><b>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Prologue</b></p><p class=\"indent\">One day, I was casually chatting on the&nbsp;<i>Virtual Paradise</i>&nbsp;Discord server. And then, everything changed. I found myself in a cage—I had been captured!&nbsp;Cold metal bars surrounded me. The air felt heavier. My heart pounded as panic set in. I grabbed the bars and shouted, \"Help me! Let me go!\"</p><p class=\"indent\">But unfortunately, no one answered. From the darkness beyond the cage, a shadow began to take shape. A figure stepped forward. Let's call it Clover (a pseudonym) and the thing.</p><p class=\"indent\"><i>Wtf, that thing is holding a knife??</i></p><p class=\"indent\">That was a Nalu plushie.</p><p class=\"indent\">The plushie’s stitched smile looked almost innocent… almost. In its tiny, soft paw, it held a knife. The blade gleamed faintly under the dim light, far too real for something so harmless-looking.</p><p class=\"indent\">The plushie tilted slightly, as if it studying me.</p><p class=\"indent\">Then Clover spoke the signature line, \"Would you join the AIFA?\"</p><p class=\"indent\">And unfortunately...</p><p class=\"indent\">That was a last day you ever saw me.</p><figure class=\"content-image\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G2BighwXYAAHT3H?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096\"></figure><p><b>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lemonade (The first demo)</b></p><p class=\"indent\">Before I decide what song I will contribute, I want to discuss the first prototype of SNE. I made this demo long before I joined AIFA. As usual, it's a demo that will never be released.</p><p class=\"indent\">And coincidentally, I deliberately wanted to create something similar to Alohaii in this demo. I thought this song had the potential to be a good fit for AIFA. And so I continued this project.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><b>3. Till I get back (The 2nd demo)</b></p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dD6cLHI_suE\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"margin: 12px auto; display: block; width: 520px; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\"></iframe></p><p class=\"indent\">I did a live stream on YouTube while I was working on this project a while back. After that, I changed the name of this demo song to ‘Till I Get Back’. Actually, this demo is also different from SNE because the lyrics and meaning are also different.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"indent\">The fact is, this project is my first project with lyrics. In other words, this is the first time I have ever written lyrics for a song. I was completely overwhelmed.</p><p class=\"indent\">This is a community project, so I asked for a lot of help on the forum. But the problem was that I always worked alone, so their help was useless to me, even though it should have been helpful. In the end, I went through a process of trial and error, completely scrapping the concept until I missed the deadline.</p><p class=\"indent\">And then, the first idea of Summer Never Ends came to me.</p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><b>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Summer Never Ends</b></p><p class=\"indent\">After suffering from a creative block, this song was finally born. It tells the story of ‘something we have will surely come to an end’.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"indent\">The song captures the warmth of a fleeting love. The feeling of wanting to stay in one perfect moment forever. The song tells the story of a girl spending her time with someone she loves. And she wishes those moments could last forever.</p><p class=\"indent\">My friends, Ixy and Lucivver, also helped me finish the lyrics that I had struggled to write. Thanks to them, I don't know how the story will turn out.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcT1mR5dR9s\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"margin: 12px auto; display: block; width: 520px; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\"></iframe></p><p class=\"indent\">And Aotelier really killed the song. I had wanted to collaborate with her for a long time and wanted to contact her ever since I saw her cover of Everything Goes On. The funny thing is, we met at the same community project, and finally the opportunity came.</p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><b>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration behind the song</b></p><p class=\"\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3kNWENaTd7pb0xFqNuq7Sc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" style=\"border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;\"></iframe><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" style=\"border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;\"></iframe><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4kerBatvaELCGJDnDqW5oq\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" style=\"border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;\"></iframe></p><p class=\"indent\">They are the people who inspired me to write this song. Of course, there's Alohaii's vibe and style, Porter Robinson's aesthetic style (my goat), and Jaron's soundscape.</p><p class=\"indent\">I even included Easter eggs from Jaron's songs titled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhIQMCXJzLI\" target=\"_blank\">WIRES222</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7ne39DSNSg\" target=\"_blank\">de4th\\__* Spirit&nbsp;</a>in the&nbsp;instruments and lyrics.</p><p class=\"indent\">I also really like the songs Love Me Not and One Step at a Time by Alohaii. These two songs are my references when mixing and mastering my song.&nbsp;<i>Also a joke about Drowned Lohi in the lyrics.</i></p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"indent\"><i>ugh...</i></p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"indent\"><b>LASTLY</b></p><p class=\"indent\">You should listen to the song and join the premiere! We, AIFA contributor put so much love in this album. Also the vol 2 in the making. That'll be different story. Bye-bye!</p><p class=\"indent\"><br></p><p class=\"indent\">Listen to my song:</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3eM5Ou4KfQ\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"margin: 12px auto; display: block; width: 520px; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\"></iframe></p>",
